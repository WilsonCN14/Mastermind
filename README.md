# Mastermind

Mastermind is a board game where the computer randomly places four colored pegs in a row and the player has six guesses to guess which color and which order each peg is in. To help the player guess the correct colored sequence, after the player makes a guess, the computer shows the player a number of black pegs that represents the number of pegs in the correct color and position and a number of white pegs that represents the number of pegs in the correct color but not the correct position.

In the game I created, the game is player can choose to play the game on the command line or watch the computer play the game against itself.

Currently, the game is playable on the command line. In the future, I would like make it playable on a GUI.
